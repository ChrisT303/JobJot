# JobJot

This is a job search tracker application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. The application allows users to track their job search progress, including job applications, interviews, and job offers.

## Getting Started

To get started with the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the dependencies by running npm install in the root directory and the client directory.
3. Create a .env file in the root directory and set the following environment variables:


* `MONGODB_URL=<your MongoDB connection string>`
* `JWT_SECRET=<a secret key for JSON Web Tokens>`
* `JWT_EXPIRE=<Your time limit>`

4. Start the server by running npm run server in the root directory.

5. Start the client by running npm start in the client directory.


## Usage
Once the application is running, you can use it to track your job search progress. You can add new job applications, including the job title, company, location, and application date. You can also update the status of each application, including whether you've received a response, whether you've been invited for an interview, and whether you've received a job offer.

The application also allows you to add notes and reminders for each job application, which can be useful for keeping track of follow-up emails and phone calls.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used to build the application:

* MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store job application data.
* Express: A Node.js web application framework used to build the server-side API.
* React: A JavaScript library used to build the client-side user interface.
* Node.js: A JavaScript runtime used to build the server-side API.
* JSON Web Tokens (JWT): A standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
